# Examples
This repository provides examples of how to create different projects at the Guardian.
The aim is to provide a reference implementation, to make it easy to go from zero to something.

It is worth noting, however, that the examples might be stale and not follow current best practices.
If you notice any examples of this, you're encouraged to update them.

To keep things simple, this repository is not setup as a mono-repo.
Instead, there is a branch per example.

## The examples
- [A TypeScript lambda](https://github.com/guardian/example-typescript-lambda)

## Adding an example
TODO.
